You can use the following information as a reference for the previous chapter.

1. You can use the following YAML file for your build pipeline as a reference

# Starter pipeline
# Start with a minimal pipeline that you can customize to build and deploy your code.
# Add steps that build, run tests, deploy, and more:
# https://aka.ms/yaml
trigger:
- master
 
pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'
 
steps:
- task: PublishPipelineArtifact@1
  inputs:
    targetPath: '$(Pipeline.Workspace)'
    artifact: 'drop'
    publishLocation: 'pipeline'
2. You can add the following to the Azure CLI task in the release pipeline. Just ensure to change the name of the storage account.

az storage account create -g newgrp1 -n terraform10001 -l centralus --sku Standard_LRS
az storage container create --name terraform --acount-name terraform10001 
az storage account keys list -g newgrp1 --account-name terraform10001 --query "[0].value" --output tsv > temp.txt
$content = Get-Content temp.txt -First 1
$key = '"{0}"' -f $content
